# Use 'ldd' command to list libraries linked from an object file.
ldd <object file>

# Use 'file' command to view architecture of an object file.
file <ojectfile>

# Use 'objdump' command to read contents of ELF files.

# List object file sections.

# Use option -e to filter the function calls.
ltrace -e 'function_name' <./file>

# Use 'strace' to trace function calls from statically linked libraries.
strace <./file>
